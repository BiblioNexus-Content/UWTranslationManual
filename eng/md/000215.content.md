## Training Before Translation Begins (id: 689657)

### What to Know Before Translation

It is recommended that you consult the Translation Manual frequently as you translate. Before you start translating, we recommend that you start working your way through the Translation Manual at least until you know the difference between a literal translation and a meaning\-based translation. Much of the rest of the Translation Manual can be used as a “just\-in\-time” learning resource.

Some important subjects that everyone on the translation team must learn before starting a translation project include:

* The Qualities of a Good Translation — The definition of a good translation
* The Translation Process — How a good translation is made

    + Form and Meaning — The difference between form and meaning
        + Meaning\-Based Translations — How to make a meaning\-based translation

Some other important topics as you get started also include:

* Choose a Translation Style — Important decisions that must be made that will guide the translation process
* Choosing What to Translate — Suggestions for where to start translating
* First Draft — How to make a first draft
* Help with Translating — Using translation helps

When you have Set Up a Translation Team and want to make a First Draft of your translation, use translationStudio. We recommend that you follow this Translation Process.
