### Description

Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULT means. The Notes may have a definition or a description of the word or phrase to help you understand what it means.

### Translation Notes Examples

Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence format. Here are examples:

It is like children sitting the marketplace, who call out to one another and say, “We played a **flute** for you.” (Matthew 11:16b\-17a ULT)

* **marketplace** — a large, open\-air area where people would come to sell their goods
* **flute** — a long, hollow musical instrument which is played by blowing air in or over one end

Behold, those in expensive clothing and living in luxury are in **kings’ palaces.** (Luke 7:25b ULT)

* **kings’ palaces** — the large, expensive houses that kings live in
