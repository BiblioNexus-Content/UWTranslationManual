    "content": "<h3>Description</h3><p>All languages have ways of showing that the same person fills two different roles in a sentence. English does this by using reflexive pronouns. These are pronouns that refer to someone or something that has already been mentioned in a sentence. In English the reflexive pronouns are: “myself,” “yourself,” “himself,” “herself,” “itself,” “ourselves,” “yourselves,” and “themselves.” Other languages may have other ways to show this.</p><h1>Reason This Is a Translation Issue</h1><ul><li><p>Languages have different ways of showing that the same person fills two different roles in a sentence. For those languages, translators will need to know how to translate the English reflexive pronouns.</p></li><li><p>The reflexive pronouns in English also have other functions.</p></li></ul><h3>Uses of Reflexive Pronouns</h3><ul><li><p>To show that the same person or things fills two different roles in a sentence</p></li><li><p>To emphasize a person or thing in the sentence</p></li><li><p>To show that someone did something alone</p></li><li><p>To show that someone or something was alone</p></li></ul><h3>Examples From the Bible</h3><p>Reflexive pronouns are used to show the same person or thing fills two different roles in a sentence.</p><p>If <strong>I</strong> should testify about <strong>myself</strong>, my testimony would not be true. (John 5:31 ULT)</p><p>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and <strong>many</strong> went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover in order to purify <strong>themselves</strong>. (John 11:55 ULT)</p><p>Reflexive pronouns are used to emphasize a person or thing in the sentence.</p><p><strong>Jesus himself</strong> was not baptizing, but his disciples were. (John 4:2 ULT)</p><p>So they left the crowd, taking Jesus with them, just as he was, in the boat. There also were other boats with him. Then a violent windstorm arose and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was already full of water. But <strong>Jesus himself</strong> was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. (Mark 4:36–38a ULT)</p><p>Reflexive pronouns are used to show that someone did something alone.</p><p>When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again up the mountain <strong>by himself</strong>. (John 6:15 ULT)</p><p>Reflexive pronouns are used to show that someone or something was alone.</p><p>He saw the linen cloths lying there and the cloth that had been on his head. <strong>It</strong> was not lying with the linen cloths but was folded up in a place <strong>by itself</strong>. (John 20:6b-7 ULT)</p><h3>Translation Strategies</h3><p>If a reflexive pronoun would have the same function in your language, consider using it. If not, here are some other strategies.</p><p>(1) In some languages people put something on the verb to show that the object of the verb is the same as the subject. (2) In some languages people emphasize a certain person or thing by referring to it in a special place in the sentence. (3) In some languages people emphasize a certain person or thing by adding something to that word or putting another word with it. (4) In some languages people show that someone did something alone by using a word like “alone.” (5) In some languages people show that something was alone by using a phrase that tells about where it was.</p><h3>Examples of Translation Strategies Applied</h3><p>(1) In some languages people modify the verb to show that the object of the verb is the same as the subject.</p><p>If I should testify about <strong>myself</strong> alone, my testimony would not be true. (John 5:31)</p><p>“If I should <strong>self-testify</strong> alone, my testimony would not be true.”</p><p>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover in order to <strong>purify themselves</strong>. (John 11:55)</p><p>“Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out from country before the Passover in order to <strong>self-purify</strong>.”</p><p>(2) In some languages people emphasize a certain person or thing by referring to it in a special place in the sentence.</p><p><strong>He himself</strong> took our sickness and bore our diseases. (Matthew 8:17 ULT)</p><p>“<strong>It was he who</strong> took our sickness and bore our diseases.”</p><p><strong>Jesus himself</strong> was not baptizing, but his disciples were. (John 4:2)</p><p>“<strong>It was not Jesus who</strong> was baptizing, but his disciples were.”</p><p>(3) In some languages people emphasize a certain person or thing by adding something to that word or putting another word with it. English adds the reflexive pronoun.</p><p>But Jesus said this to test Philip, for he <strong>himself</strong> knew what he was going to do. (John 6:6)</p><p>(4) In some languages people show that someone did something alone by using a word like “alone.”</p><p>When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again up the mountain <strong>by himself</strong>. (John 6:15)</p><p>“When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again <strong>alone</strong> up the mountain.”</p><p>(5) In some languages people show that something was alone by using a phrase that tells about where it was.</p><p>He saw the linen cloths lying there and the cloth that had been on his head. It was not lying with the linen cloths but was folded up in a place <strong>by itself</strong>. (John 20:6b-7 ULT)</p><p>“He saw the linen cloths lying there and the cloth that had been on his head. It was not lying with the linen cloths but was folded up and lying <strong>in it’s own place</strong>.”</p>",
