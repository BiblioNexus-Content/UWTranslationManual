This page lists and defines some of those that are used in the Bible. In-depth study will follow</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Figures of speech are ways of saying things that use words in non-literal ways. That is, the meaning of a figure of speech is not the same as the more direct meaning of its words. In order to translate the meaning, you need to be able to recognize figures of speech and know what the figure of speech means in the source language. Then you can choose either a figure of speech or a direct way to communicate that same meaning in the target language.</p><h3>Types</h3><p>Listed below are different types of Figures of Speech.
