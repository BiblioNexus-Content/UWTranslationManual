To ensure that your translation is of the highest quality, work together with other believers who speak your language to translate, check, and distribute the translated content.</p><p>Here are some ways to include others that can help improve the quality of the translation.</p><ul><li><p>Read the translation out loud to someone. Have him notice if the sentences connect well. Ask that person to point out words or phrases that do not sound right or are unclear. Make changes so that it sounds as if someone from your community is speaking.</p></li><li><p>Ask someone to read your translation to check your spelling. You may have spelled a word differently when a different spelling was not necessary. Some words change in different situations, but some words can stay the same in every situation. Take note of these changes, so others can know what decisions you have made on the spelling of your language.</p></li><li><p>Ask yourself if the way you wrote can be recognized easily by speakers of different dialects in your language community. If there is something that is not clear in your translation, ask others how they would say it.</p></li></ul><p>Make changes to the translation before you distribute it to a wider audience.</p><p>Remember: if possible, work together with other believers who speak your language to translate, check, and distribute the translated content, ensuring that it is of the highest quality and that as many people as possible can read and understand it.</p><p>(You may also want to watch the video at https://ufw.io/guidelines_collab.)</p>",
