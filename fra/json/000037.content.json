    "content": "<p>Grammar has two main parts: words and structure. Structure involves how we put words together to form phrases, clauses, and sentences. Here is a brief overview of Grammar Topics we will deal with in detail.</p><p><strong>Parts of Speech</strong> — Every word in a language belongs to a category called a part of speech. (See <span resourceId=\"26714\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Parts of Speech</span>.)</p><p><strong>Sentences</strong> — When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being. (See <span resourceId=\"26725\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sentence Structure</span>.)</p><ul><li><p>Sentences can be statements, questions, commands, or exclamations. (See <span resourceId=\"26726\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Exclamations</span>.)</p></li><li><p>Sentences can have more than one clause. (See <span resourceId=\"26725\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sentence Structure</span>.)</p></li><li><p>Some languages have both active and passive sentences. (See <span resourceId=\"26672\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Active or Passive</span>.)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Possession</strong> — This shows that there is a relationship between two nouns. In English it is marked with “of” as in “the love of God,” or with “’s” as in “God’s love,” or with a possessive pronoun as in “his love.” (See <span resourceId=\"26717\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Possession</span>.)</p><p><strong>Quotations</strong> — A quotation is a report of what someone else has said.</p><ul><li><p>Quotations normally have two parts: Information about who said something and what the person said. (See <span resourceId=\"26840\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quotations and Quote Margins</span>.)</p></li><li><p>Quotations can be either direct quotes or indirect quotes. (See <span resourceId=\"26719\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Direct and Indirect Quotations</span>.)</p></li><li><p>Quotes can have quotes within them. (See <span resourceId=\"26721\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quotes within Quotes</span>.)</p></li><li><p>Quotes can be marked to make it easy for readers to understand who said what. (See <span resourceId=\"26720\" resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quote Markings</span>.)</p></li></ul>",
