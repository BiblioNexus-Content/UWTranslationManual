(Psalms 17:8–9 ULT)</p><p>Here is another example of how the wings represent protection.</p><p>Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, for I take refuge in you until these troubles are over. I stay under <strong>your wings</strong> for protection until this destruction is over. (Psalm 57:1 ULT)</p><h1>DANGEROUS ANIMALS represent dangerous people</h1><p>In Psalms, David referred to his enemies as lions.</p><p>My life is among <strong>lions</strong>; I am among those who are ready to devour me.

Your adversary—the devil—like a roaring <strong>lion</strong> is stalking around, looking for someone to devour. (1 Peter 5:8 ULT)</p><p>In Matthew, Jesus called false prophets wolves because of the harm they did to people by their lies.</p><p>Beware of false prophets, those who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous <strong>wolves</strong>.

(Psalm 103:5 ULT)</p><p>For Yahweh says this, “See, the enemy will come flying like an <strong>eagle</strong>, spreading out his wings over Moab.” (Jeremiah 48:40 ULT)</p><h1>SHEEP or a FLOCK OF SHEEP represents people who need to be led or are in danger</h1><p>My people have been a lost <strong>flock</strong>. Their shepherds have led them astray in the mountains. (Jeremiah 50:6 ULT)</p><p>He led his own people out like <strong>sheep</strong> and guided them through the wilderness like a <strong>flock</strong>.
